        World War I, an international conflict that in 1914–18 embroiled most of the nations of Europe along with Russia, the
        United States, the Middle East, and other regions. The war pitted the Central Powers—mainly Germany, Austria-Hungary,
        and Turkey—against the Allies—mainly France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and, from 1917, the United States. It
        ended with the defeat of the Central Powers. The war was virtually unprecedented in the slaughter, carnage, and
        destruction it caused.

        World War I was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It led to the fall of four great
        imperial dynasties (in Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey), resulted in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia,
        and, in its destabilization of European society, laid the groundwork for World War II.
        
        The last surviving veterans of World War I were American serviceman Frank Buckles (died in February 2011), British-born
        Australian serviceman Claude Choules (died in May 2011), and British servicewoman Florence Green (died in February
        2012), the last surviving veteran of the war.
        The outbreak of war
        
        With Serbia already much aggrandized by the two Balkan Wars (1912–13, 1913), Serbian nationalists turned their attention
        back to the idea of “liberating” the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary. Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević, head of Serbia’s
        military intelligence, was also, under the alias “Apis,” head of the secret society Union or Death, pledged to the
        pursuit of this pan-Serbian ambition. Believing that the Serbs’ cause would be served by the death of the Austrian
        archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph, and learning that the Archduke was
        about to visit Bosnia on a tour of military inspection, Apis plotted his assassination. Nikola Pašić, the Serbian prime
        minister and an enemy of Apis, heard of the plot and warned the Austrian government of it, but his message was too
        cautiously worded to be understood.

        Sophie, duchess of Hohenberg, in an open carriage at Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, shortly before their
        assassination, June 28, 1914.
        
        At 11:15 am on June 28, 1914, in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife, Sophie, duchess
        of Hohenberg, were shot dead by a Bosnian Serb, Gavrilo Princip. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz,
        Graf (count) Conrad von Hötzendorf, and the foreign minister, Leopold, Graf von Berchtold, saw the crime as the occasion
        for measures to humiliate Serbia and so to enhance Austria-Hungary’s prestige in the Balkans. Conrad had already
        (October 1913) been assured by William II of Germany’s support if Austria-Hungary should start a preventive war against
        Serbia. This assurance was confirmed in the week following the assassination, before William, on July 6, set off upon
        his annual cruise to the North Cape, off Norway.
