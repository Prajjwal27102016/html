        My favourate hobby is Badminton
        Badminton is quite a popular sport that is played all over the world.
        Badminton is a sport played by people of all age groups.
        Casually, it is played outdoors, in yards or beaches.
        Badminton matches take place where two players compete against each other.
        Sometimes, group matches take place as well.
        The place where the match takes place is called a badminton court.
        The court is divided into two parts with the help of a net.
        Players play light shoes which helps them run and bounce around in the court.
        Playing badminton, as a sport is perfect for health and works as a good exercise.
        It is said that the game was developed amongst the British.
