    <p>World War II[b] or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two
    coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations
    mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing
    of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict
    in history, resulting in 70 to 85 million deaths, more than half of which were civilians. Millions died in genocides,
    including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan,
    and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for war crimes.
    
    The causes of World War II included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of World War I and the rises of fascism in
    Europe and militarism in Japan. Key events preceding the war included Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Spanish
    Civil War, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and Germany's annexations of Austria and the
    Sudetenland. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf
    Hitler, invaded Poland, leading the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany. Poland was divided between
    Germany and the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In 1940, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and parts
    of Finland and Romania. After the fall of France in June 1940, the war continued mainly between Germany and the British
    Empire, with fighting in the Balkans, Mediterranean, and Middle East, the aerial Battle of Britain and the Blitz, and
    naval Battle of the Atlantic. Through campaigns and treaties, Germany gained control of much of continental Europe and
    formed the Axis alliance with Italy, Japan, and other countries. In June 1941, Germany led an invasion of the Soviet
    Union, opening the Eastern Front and initially making large territorial gains.
    
    In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories in Asia and the Pacific, including at Pearl Harbor in
    Hawaii, leading the United States to enter the war against Japan and Germany. Japan conquered much of coastal China and
    Southeast Asia, but its advances in the Pacific were halted in June 1942 at the Battle of Midway. In late 1942, Axis
    forces were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union, and in 1943 their continued defeats on the
    Eastern Front, an Allied invasion of Italy, and Allied offensives in the Pacific forced them into retreat on all fronts.
    In 1944, the Western Allies invaded France at Normandy as the Soviet Union recaptured its pre-war territory and the U.S.
    crippled Japan's navy and captured key Pacific islands. The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of
    German-occupied territories; invasions of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the
    fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. On 6 and 9 August, the U.S.
    dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Faced with an imminent Allied invasion, the prospect of further
    atomic bombings, and a Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its unconditional surrender
    on 15 August, and signed a surrender document on 2 September 1945.
    
    World War II transformed the political, economic, and social structures of the world, and established the foundation of
    international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The United Nations was created to
    foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the
    Soviet Union, the UK, and the U.S.—becoming the permanent members of its security council. The Soviet Union and U.S.
    emerged as rival global superpowers, setting the stage for the half-century Cold War. In the wake of Europe's
    devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Many countries
    whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.

    World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1][2] with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and
    France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War
    include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,[3][4] or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria,
    on 19 September 1931.[5][6] Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War
    and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7] Other
    proposed starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The British
    historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the
    forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or
    prelude to World War II.[10][11]
    
    The exact date of the war's end also is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war
    ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September
    1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.[12] A 1990
    treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most
    post–World War II issues.[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14] although
    the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also
    restored full diplomatic relations between them.[15]</p>
