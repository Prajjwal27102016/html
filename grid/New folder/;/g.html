   <p><code>A lion, often referred to as the "King of the Jungle," is a large, powerful cat native to Africa, known for its majestic
mane on adult males and social living within groups called prides; these prides consist of related females, cubs, and a
few dominant males who primarily defend the territory, while the females are the primary hunters, preying on large
herbivores like zebras and wildebeest; due to their apex predator status, lions play a crucial role in maintaining the
balance of their ecosystem, but unfortunately face conservation challenges due to habitat loss and poaching.
