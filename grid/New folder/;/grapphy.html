    <div class="container"><h1>Scratch</h1>
    <p>Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an
    educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[9][10] Users on the site can create projects on the website
    using a block-like interface. Scratch was conceived and designed through collaborative National Science Foundation
    grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai.[11] Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab and has been
    translated into 70+ languages, being used in most parts of the world. Scratch is taught and used in after-school
    centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of 15 February 2023, community
    statistics on the language's official website show more than 123 million projects shared by over 103 million users, and
    more than 95 million monthly website visits.[12] Overall, more than 1,140,000,000 projects have been created in total,
    with the site reaching its 1,000,000,000th project on April 12th, 2024.
    
    Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped
    together and manipulated on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website lets
    users mix together different media (including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating and
    "remixing" projects, like video games, animations, music, and simulations.[13]
    Scratch 3.0
    User interface
    A program to change the background and make a sprite speak
    
    The Scratch interface is divided into three main sections: a stage area, block palette, and a coding area to place and
    arrange the blocks into scripts that can be run by pressing the green flag or clicking on the code itself. Users may
    also create their own code blocks, which will appear in the "My Blocks" section.
    
    The stage area features the results (e.g., animations, turtle graphics, either in a small or normal size, with a
    full-screen option also available) and all sprites' thumbnails being listed in the bottom area. The stage uses x and y
    coordinates, <mark>with 0,0 being the stage center.[14]</mark>
    
    <code>With a sprite selected at the bottom of the staging area, blocks of code can be applied by dragging them from the block
    palette into the coding area. The Costumes tab allows users to change the look of the sprite with a vector and bitmap
    editor in order to create various effects, including animation.[14] The Sounds tab allows attaching sounds and music to
    a sprite.[15]</code>
    
    When creating sprites and also backgrounds, users can draw their own sprites</p></div>
    <div class="container"><h1>code.org</h1><p>Code.org is a non-profit organization and educational website founded by Hadi and Ali Partovi,[1] aimed at K-12 students
    who specialize in computer science.[2] The website includes free coding lessons and other resources. The initiative also
    targets schools in the United States in an attempt to encourage them to include more computer science classes in the
    curriculum.[3][4] In 2013, they launched the Hour of Code across the United States to promote computer science during
    Computer Science Education Week.[5][6][7]</p></div>
