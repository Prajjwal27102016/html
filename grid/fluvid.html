        <h1>India national bird peacock</h1>
        <p>The peacock (Pavo cristatus), a magnificent bird known for its vibrant iridescent feathers and elaborate tail, is the
        national bird of India, recognized for its beauty and cultural significance.
        Here's a paragraph elaborating on the peacock as India's national bird:
        The peacock, or Indian peafowl, is a symbol of India, recognized for its stunning beauty and cultural importance. With
        its iridescent blue neck and breast, a fan-shaped crest, and a long, slender neck, the male peacock (often called a
        peacock) is easily distinguished from the brownish, smaller female (peahen) that lacks the elaborate tail. In Indian
        traditions, the peacock holds religious and mythological significance, often associated with the god Indra, god of
        thunder, rain and war, and Lord Murugan, the son of Lord Shiva. The Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 provides full
        protection to these beautiful birds.

        The Indian peacock has been given the stature of the National Bird of India. This joyful and beautiful bird has been a
        significant part of the Indian history as well as mythology. The colourful and bright feathers that add to the beauty of
        peacock also serve as an item to beautify various things and places.</p>
