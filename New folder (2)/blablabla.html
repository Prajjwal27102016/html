        Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal
        origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is
        ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.
        Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have
        evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
        
        Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtaining food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally
        use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food
        industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food
        distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food
        and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total
        greenhouse gas emissions.[1]
        
        The food system has a significant impact on a wide range of other social and political issues, including sustainability,
        biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food security. Food safety and security are
        monitored by international agencies, like the International Association for Food Protection, the World Resources.

Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
oven.

The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In
Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In
casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
using a home oven.

In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12]
Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13]</p>
